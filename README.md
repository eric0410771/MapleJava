# MapleJava

A small project i made in java course two years ago. For some reason, i start to collect some projects i made and upload them on the github.

# How to execute?
For anyone to execute the whole project, just type the following instruction in command line.
java First_2 

# Warning
This is just a small project, i think i might not update it. Although, it is not the final version i presented on the course.
